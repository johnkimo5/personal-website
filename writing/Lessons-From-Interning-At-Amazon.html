                <h1>Interning At Amazon</h1>
                <div class="article-meta">December 15, 2025</div>
            </header>

            <div class="content">
                <p>My goal is to document some lessons I learned during my first real SWE internship @ Amazon.</p>
                
                <h2>Ask Questions</h2>
                <p>The first two weeks are the only time where you can ask dumb questions and not get penalized. 12 weeks goes by really quickly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Schedule 1-on-1s with your teammates to get to know them better. If you're a stranger to them, why would they want to really help you?</li>
                    <li>Take notes during meetings. Ideally, recording them would be best.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Intern Diary</h2>
                <p>I would organize a weekly goal and break it down into dailies. Write down action items and key deliverables.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use something like Notion for this.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Fix your Sleep</h2>
                <p>During school, having a bad schedule is something you can easily get away with. But while you're working, having a better sleep schedule is crucial.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll probably only get 2-3 hours in the morning to do real work.</li>
                    <li>After lunch, you're probably not going to be productive. So don't account for this time to make stuff up.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Extra Time</h2>
                <p>You don't know what you don't know. Take the extra time to really understand code, design documents, etc.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This works well with point #1. Put in a lot of time because a strong start means a lot.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
